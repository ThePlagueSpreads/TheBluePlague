# Welcome Divers...
This is a silly April Fools' Day mod designed to be a short, absurd and confusing experience. The source code has been published for anyone who is interested in the techniques I used, including but not limited to:
- Custom game modes (particularly the ominous 'nothing' mode)
- Custom splash text
- Custom main menu buttons
- Water fog modifications
- Basic asset bundle usage
