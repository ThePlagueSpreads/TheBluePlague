# The Blue Plague
> This is the best Subnautica mod that has ever been made

â€” me

This is a silly April Fools' Day mod designed to be a short, absurd and confusing experience. The source code has been published for anyone who is interested in the techniques I used, including but not limited to:
- Custom game-modes (particularly 'nothing' mode)
- Custom splash text
- Custom main menu buttons
- Water fog modifications
- Basic asset bundle usage
